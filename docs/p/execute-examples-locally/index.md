# Execute Examples Locally

First, take the following preparations:

- Clone Grid Engine repository to your local file system
- Install a webserver (for example [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) for node)

Then navigate to your cloned [grid-engine/docs/public](https://github.com/Annoraaq/grid-engine/tree/master/docs/public/) directory and serve the content with your webserver from there.
In case you used [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server), simply run `http-server` from the command line. Then navigate to the URL of your local webserver (for example `http://127.0.0.1:8080/example-code/`) and browse through the examples.
