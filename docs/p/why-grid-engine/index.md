# Why Grid Engine?

Grid Engine helps you position and move objects on a **2-dimensional grid** in your **JavaScript/TypeScript** game.
It easily integrates with [Phaser.js](https://phaser.io/) but can also be used standalone. You can even run it on a server with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## What is **Grid Based Movement**?

Your objects are positioned on a 2-dimensional game board and they can move between fields, but never stop inbetween.
A simple example for this is Chess and many more board games. But also many older games from the Pok√©mon series implement this kind of movement.
It is also very famous in games from the puzzle genre.

Here is an example for grid based movement:

<img
    src="https://github.com/Annoraaq/grid-engine/raw/master/images/radius-movement-demo.gif"
    width="400"
    style="image-rendering: pixelated; display: inline"
  />

As you can see, the characters only stop in the center of a tile and never inbetween two tiles. The transition/movement between two positions is only an animation. That means that the positioning is not pixel based but grid (or tile) based.

## How can Grid Engine help me with grid based movement?

- Simple positioning
- Smooth movement animation
- Pathfinding
- 4 and 8 directions
- compatible with isometric
- automated movements

## Limitations

- non-square grids
