# Character Layers - Flying Chars with Shadows

**Press the arrow keys to move.** This demonstrates the usage of [character layers](../features/character-layers) to create flying characters with separated shadows. The shadows are represented as _characters_ in GridEngine, are non-colliding and live on the same character layer as the player.
