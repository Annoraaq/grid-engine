title: Pathfinding Restriction

# Restrict pathfinding

**Press the arrow keys to move.** This demo demonstrates how you can restrict pathfinding to a specific area (colorizes tiles). You can observe that pathfinding will not let the NPC take the shortest path to the target position, but the shortest path **within the allowed (colorized) area**.
