# Bug Reports

## Reproducing the Bug

To help us diagnose the issue efficiently, please provide a minimal reproducing example. This is a small, standalone project that demonstrates the bug using only GridEngine and minimal external dependencies. The goal is to isolate the problem from any potential conflicts within your main project.

Here's how you can achieve this:

1. **Use CodeSandbox:**  [https://codesandbox.io/](https://codesandbox.io/) is a great platform for creating isolated development environments. You can use the following pre-configured template as a starting point: [codesandbox example template](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/Annoraaq/template-esbuild-ts/main?file=%2Fsrc%2Fscenes%2FPreloader.ts%3A37%2C28). This template includes Phaser and GridEngine pre-installed.

2. **Replicate the Bug:**  Within this CodeSandbox project, write minimal code that replicates the bug you encountered in your main project. Focus on reproducing the core functionality that exhibits the issue.

**Benefits:**

* A minimal reproducing example allows GridEngine developers to focus on the bug in GridEngine itself, without needing to understand the complexities of your main project.
* It helps you narrow down if the issue is related to GridEngine or a specific configuration within your project.

**Sharing your example:**

* Once you've created the CodeSandbox project, simply share the link to the project in your bug report. 

**If creating a minimal example is not feasible:**

* In cases where creating a minimal example is too difficult, please provide as much detail as possible about the steps required to reproduce the bug in your main project. This may include relevant code snippets, specific configurations, and error messages.

By following these guidelines, you'll significantly increase the efficiency of debugging and resolving the issue.
